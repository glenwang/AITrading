Apply AI on day trading, swing trading and position trading

The primary trading theories come from How to Day Trade For a Living by Andrew Aziz, Ph.D, Mastering the Trade by John Carter, and the Complete Guide to Hedge Funds and Hedge Fund Strategies by Capocci. This project tries to embody their abstract theories with code, and even trade autonomously by the computer. 

Artificial intelligence has a great potential in pattern recognition, including recognising the price's technical patterns. 
Machine learning can handle a large amount of data and make a quick trading suggestion. 
Given the rising volumn and increasing speed of data in this digital age, machine learning in algo trading is certainly the future. 

Trading procedure:
1. Screen suitable stocks for the trading strategy. The selection criteria are given in the books. 
2. Gather price data and other indicator data as features. 
3. Train the model to predict prices and market directions. 
4. Place appropriate orders to capture the upside potential, while restrain the down-side risk.
